#  Emperors for iOS

View the official inscribed titles that each Roman emperor went under at different points in time.

This helps classicists or enthusiasts date Roman inscriptions. If they find a Roman inscription that mentions the emperor's name and one of these titles, they can use the title to figure out roughly when the inscription was made (the app contains a help page describing how you can do this).

I built this as a summer college project together with a professor at the University of Rochester Department of Classics. It was my first iOS app, and one of my first personal programming projects, so the code is not my best work. However, the app runs well and does what it is supposed to do.

This also contains my first attempt at a reusable component, "ModalWebViewController", which is just a way to display a basic web view modally in order to show a Help or About page.
